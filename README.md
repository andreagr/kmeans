# K-Means

This repo contains a simple implementation of the K-Means algorithm in Python

## Libraries

I have used the following libraries to perform the computation and plotting the result

```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### Run the code

To test the code simply run:

```
python3 kmeans.py
```
